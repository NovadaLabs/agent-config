# Website Genome OS v2.2

Agent operating system for building or replicating any website.
Input: URL (to copy) or checklist (to build from scratch).
Output: Production-ready Next.js website deployed on Vercel.

## Quick Start

```
COPY mode:  I have a URL to replicate    → read GENOME.md §COPY
BUILD mode: I have a checklist           → read GENOME.md §BUILD
FIX mode:   I have a replica to improve  → read GENOME.md §FIX
```

## Files in This Skill

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `GENOME.md` | The process — steps, gates, principles | ALWAYS read first |
| `vocabulary.md` | Web pattern detection — what to look for | Read before EXTRACT (Step 3) |
| `reference/` | Deep component/template/token specs | Read on demand during BUILD |

## How to Use

1. Read `GENOME.md` — your operating system. Follow it exactly.
2. Before Step 3 (EXTRACT), read `vocabulary.md` — it tells you what interaction patterns to detect on the target site.
3. During BUILD, pull `reference/` files on demand for specific component patterns.

## Human Setup (the ONLY manual step)

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agent-chrome-bridge && npm run launch-chrome
```

This launches Chrome with the user's login sessions. Everything after this is autonomous.

## 10 Principles (burned into this OS from 4 site replications)

1. EXTRACT > IMAGINE — every pixel traces to observed data
2. SPECS BEFORE CODE — no React until spec files exist
3. DASHBOARD FIRST — auth-gated pages are the product
4. ASSETS > CODE — real images are the #1 quality lever
5. VERIFY THEN REPORT — run all gates before telling the human
6. CLICK, DON'T SCREENSHOT — clicking tests behavior, not just rendering
7. PRODUCTION BUILD FOR VERIFICATION — npm run build && npx next start
8. QUALITY SYSTEM, NOT CHECKLIST — "I did something" ≠ "I did it completely"
9. MEGA-MENUS ARE COMPONENTS, NOT LINK LISTS — extract as visual units
10. COMPARE BOTH SITES FOR EVERY CHECK — never evaluate replica alone
